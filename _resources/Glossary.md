## Glossary

### Coliberate - Collaboratively liberate one another

[Facilitator/Joker](https://study.com/academy/lesson/theatre-of-the-oppressed-definition-history-characteristics.html) -  The moderator. The Facilitator's/Joker’s job is to oversee the games and skits, to provide structure, but not to interfere. How events unfold is up to the audience and performers.

[Forum Theater](https://dramaresource.com/forum-theatre/ )  - Breaking through the barrier between performers and audience, it enables participants to try out courses of action which could be applicable to their everyday lives.

[Image Theater](https://dramaresource.com/image-theatre/) - Still images are used to explore abstract concepts: like relationships, emotions, as well as realistic situations. Participants sculpt their own or each others’ bodies to express attitudes and emotions. These images are then placed together and brought to life.

[Participatory Action Research (PAR)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2566051/) - Seeks to understand and improve the world by changing it. It's a self-reflective inquiry that researchers and participants undertake to understand and improve upon the practices in which they participate and the situations in which they find themselves.

[Socially Engaged Art](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/s/socially-engaged-practice) - Socially engaged practice describes art that is collaborative, often participatory and involves people as the medium or material of the work

[Theater of the Oppressed](https://study.com/academy/lesson/theatre-of-the-oppressed-definition-history-characteristics.html) - Created by Augusto Boal during the 50s and 60s. He created a less passive form of theatre, one in which the audience would not just identify with characters but would actively invest in the outcome.

## Kirtika Kain

[Kirtika Kain](https://www.kirtikakain.com/bio ) is an Australian artist, raised in Australia, 'born into the Untouchable or Dalit caste within India.' The Dalit caste under the law in India, have for centuries been subjected to peforming duties within society that are degrading such as 'skinning animal carcasses, leather tanning, cleaning human waste and manual scavenging'. Kain is interested in exploring the memory within this ancestry and reclaiming and re-visualising the narrative of the Dalit caste by using materials of the Dalit livelihood such as 'brooms, religious pigments, rope, tar and leather'. Through her printmaking process, she re-transforms the materials and creates an alternative narrative.

## Tania Bruguera

Project: 10, 148, 451

[Tania Bruguera](https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/hyundai-commission-tania-bruguera) is a Cuban performance and installation artist.
Bruguera explores the emotions within politics. Her work encompasses performance, film, installation, scuppture, writing, teaching as well as site-specific works. Her purpose is to cause change through her work.

From 2nd October to 24th February 2019, Tania Bruguera exhibited at the Tate Modern. Her work titled '10, 148, 451' is a number that keeps increasing:'...the number of people who migrated from one country to another last year added to the number of migrant deaths recorded so far this year - to indicate the sheer scale of mass migration and the risks involved.  

'In the Turbine Hall is a large heat-sensitive floor. By using your body heat and working together with other visitors, you can reveal a hidden portrait of Yousef, a young man who left Syria to come to London. Meanwhile, a low-frequency sound fills the space with an unsettling energy. In a small room nearby, an organic compound in the air induces tears and provokes what the artist describes as ‘forced empathy’.'

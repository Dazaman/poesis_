## Ibrahim Mahama

### Art work: Worn traditional smocks on charcoal jute sacks

[Ibrahm Mahama](https://whitecube.com/artists/artist/him_mahama) is a Ghanian artist and author. He works primarly with found objects tranforming them to create new meanings.

Ibrahim Mahama's art work explores the concepts of 'commodity, migration, globalisation, and economic exchange.' Mahama uses jute sacks one usually finds in trade markets of Ghana as his inspiration. The Jute Sacks have various functions transporting food, charcoal and other commodities.

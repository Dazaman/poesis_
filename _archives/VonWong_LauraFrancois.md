## Von Wang & Laura Francois

Project: Clothing The Loop

"The average person wears about 2500kg of clothing in their lifetime. Picturing that amount of clothes is almost impossible.'

Von Wang and Laura Francois are photographers who stumbled upon the weight of this amount of clothing in a bankrupt warehouse of a garment company in Phnom Penh. The team and more than 50 volunteers from around five countries created a monumental art exhibition portraying from the vast amount of clothing and called it 'Clothing the Loop'.

'We simply wanted to create installations that would remind people of where their clothes were born.'

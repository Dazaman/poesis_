## Lygia Clarke

Work: Dialogue: Goggles, 1968

Lygia Clark (1920 - 1988) was a Brazilian artist who co-founded the Neo-Concretist movement in Brazil. She moved away from painting in the early 60s, and, beginning with Walking, began to experiment with everyday materials and eventually changed the relationship between the artist, the artwork and the audience/participant.

Clark's Dialogue belongs to her Nostalgia of the Body series, which began in 1964 with individual and two-person sensorial explorations, and developed, after 1968, into collective creations she titled Organic or Ephemeral Architectures. The Dialogue goggles restrict the visual field of the two participants to an eye-to-eye exchange, merging interactivity and dialogism, two of the central concerns in Clark's work.

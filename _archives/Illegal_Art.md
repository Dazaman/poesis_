## Illegal Art

Illegal Art (2001 - Present)

Project: The Last Word

Illegal Art, founded in the summer of 2001, is a collective of artists whose goal is to create participatory-based public art to inspire self-reflection, thought and human connection. Their projects have been installed throughout the United States and South America, Europe and The Middle East. Their projects have been published in an array of digital and print media.
Illegal Art also collaborates with other groups and institutions such as the architectural collective, 1319, based in Buenos Aires, Argentina and The Museum of
Urban Art of Rome. Their work has been published in numerous catalogs throughout the United States and Europe.

Illegal Art is Otis Kriegel and Michael McDevitt.

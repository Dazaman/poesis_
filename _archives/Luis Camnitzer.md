## Luis Camnitzer

Project: Art History Lesson, 2000

Luis Cmnitzer is a German born Uruguayan artist, art critic, academic and curator at the center of 1960's Conceptual Art.

In the art work, ['Art History Lesson'](https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/33084), slide projectors which encapsulate the sense of a lecture hall range around the gallery space, casting the projected light onto the walls. This symbolises the controlled way art history has been written by those in power, which leaves narratives out such as those of Latin America.

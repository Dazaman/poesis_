## Heidi Quante

Project: Bureau of Linguistical Reality

Heidi Quante is an American artist with an interdisciplinary focus on environmental and human rights. Quante is the founder of the non-profit ['Creative Catalysts'](https://creativecatalysts.org/testimonials/) which is an organisation that seeks to find innovative ideas to approach the challenging social and environmental issues of our time.  

[The Bureau of Linguistical Reality](https://bureauoflinguisticalreality.com/about/) was created by Heidi Quante and Alicia Escott (Co-Founder & Executive Director of Interspecies Advancement (EDIA) and Treasurer of Geologic Time (TGT)) to give meaning to climate change by creating a new dicitonary of terms or language. 

'The vision of the artwork is to provide new words to express what people are feeling and experiencing as our world changes as climate change accelerates'

## Agatha Goethe Snape

Project: All Schools Should be Art Schools, Symposium on Art Education, presented by Kaldor Public Art Projects and UNSW Art & Design, Sydney, 24 October 2018

[Agatha Goethe Snape](https://www.mca.com.au/artists-works/artists/agatha-gothe-snape/), born in 1980, Sydney, New South Wales, currently lives and works in Sydney. Her practice encompasses various forms, from performance, dance, drawings to 'collaboratively produced objects' and presentations.

Snape's [work](https://www.artlink.com.au/articles/4778/editorial-new-futures-in-art-education/) revolves around the them of art education and de-tangling concepts within the art education system and creating visual maps which aide the viewer's understanding of 'art' and 'education'.

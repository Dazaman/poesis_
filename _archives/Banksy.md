## Banksy

Artist: Banksy
Project: Louise Michel, 2019

Banksy sponsors a rescue boat, Louise Michel.
Street artist Banksy has recently sponsored a boat to rescue migrants on sea. The boat, formerly known as Suroît was a French customs boat which was bought by an anonymous bidder (read: Banksy). It was then refitted and renamed after Louise Michel, a french feminist and anarchist during late 19th century.

According to the Guardian report, Banksy emailed Pia Klemp in September 2019, asking whether he could sponsor a new mission. "I am an artist from the UK and I’ve made some work about the migrant crisis, obviously I can’t keep the money. Could you use it to buy a new boat or something?” he wrote.

Banksy is not involved in the day-to-day operations of the ship and is only providing financial support. There are ten crew members on board. Pia Klemp is the captain of the ship. Klemp is a former captain of the Iuventa and the Sea-Watch 3.

### Update

As of 29th August, Louise Michel struggled to manoeuvre due to an overcrowded deck, however a charity vessel, Sea-Watch 4 took upon the survivors and the vessel no longer is in crisis, as reported by Al-Jazeera today. (hyperlink)

## Actions and Interruptions (2007)

What happens when a group of performance artists go undercover at Tate Modern? Artists Dora García, Jiří Kovanda, Roman Ondák, Mario Garcia Torres, Nina Jan Beier and Marie Jan Lund explore the way visitors behave in a museum, subtly intervening to disrupt the usual codes of conduct.
Ordinary activities like standing in a queue, travelling on an escalator or listening to a gallery tour-guide takes on strange new dimensions.

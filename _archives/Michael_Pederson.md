## Michael Pederson

[Michael Pederson](https://miguelmarquezoutside.com/) aka Miguel Marquez is an artist based in Sydney.

Pederson artistically intervenes in the urban spaces of Sydney by [creating signs](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2015/10/sydney-street-signs/) that are thought provoking, quirky and humorous near every day [places](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2017/09/michael-pedersons-lighthearted-street-art-is-hidden-in-plain-sight/) such as parks, streets and industrial zones.

Pederson's purpose is to shift the spectator's mundane every day experience into a curious, introspective perpective of our surroundings.

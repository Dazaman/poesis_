### Artist: Cassie Thornton

### Project: [Secret Chakra: Feminist Economics Yoga](http://feministeconomicsdepartment.com/secret-chakra-feminist-economics-yoga)

Cassie Thornton is 'a feminist economist and artist' Her social practice explores how financial and social debt affect the -psychology of the individual and public. Thornton aims to bring alternative services like 'debt visualizations', 'wall demolition', 'feminist economics yoga' and 'alternative credit reports'.

The purpose of the practices is to uncover how power functions in a capitalist world and how to subvert that to serve the people.

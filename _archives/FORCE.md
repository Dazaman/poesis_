The Monument Quilt is a project of ‘FORCE’ which is an art and activist collective dedicated to creating a culture of consent. The Monument Quilt is an enormous red fabric quilt stitched with stories of survivors of sexual assault.

The Monument Quilt is a platform to express individual stories and a public space to heal. It also seeks to collectively work towards changing ‘how Americans respond to rape.’

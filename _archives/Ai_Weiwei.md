## Ai Weiwei

Project: Soleil Levant, 2017 |  Kunsthal Charlottenberg

Chinese activist, architect and artist, Ai Weiwei has collected over 14,000 life jackets and has tied them together, draping them up and down the columns of the Berlin Konzerthaus. The jackets are coming from Lesbos or Lesvos, a Greek island that acts as a middle point for those Syrian refugees fleeing from their homeland on their way to Europe.

The 14,000 life jacks utilized for the installation were used to demonstrate the number of lives that are risked in search of peace. So many individuals lose their lives in search of a peaceful area to settle and Ai Weiwei created the installation to represent the huge number in a visual manner that audiences would resonate with and understand. The installation went a long way in highlighting the plight of Syrian refugees with the aim of forcing the public and the administration to do the right thing and restore peace in Syria.

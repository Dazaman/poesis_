### [Episode 1: Poiesis.SocialArt: Who are We?](https://soundcloud.com/user-384729018/episode-1-who-we-are)

Hi! This is Dania and Maha. Creators of the page Poiesis.socialart on Instagram. This is a brief intro of our background in art and also the reason for our interest in exploring the topic of socially engaged art. We wanted to first introduce ourselves before we talk about socially engaged art itself and the artists who have shaped it. You can also find us on our separate instagram accounts [@dania.sk.art](https://www.instagram.com/dania.sk.art/) and [@_thegentlewoman_](https://www.instagram.com/_thegentlewoman_/).
Excited to share the start of this with all of you! We are working hard on addressing a lot of topics and on researching so this is a steady process to improve and produce better. Thank you for listening!

### [Episode 2: What is Socially Engaged Art? (Part 1)](https://soundcloud.com/user-384729018/episode-2-part-1-definition-and-movement)

Welcome to another episode with us! In this episode, we recap on the previous segment and then move onto talking about the definition of socially engaged arts and its movement. We refer to two books ‘Mapping the Landscape of Socially Engaged Art’ by the Helicon Collaborative, and ‘Education for Socially Engaged Art’ by Pablo Helgueara to elaborate on this subject, and give examples.
We also touch upon socially engaged artists in Pakistan and the challenging but socially changing work they are doing.

Hope you enjoy listening to the introduction!

### [Episode 5: Poiesis with Sobia Zaidi](https://soundcloud.com/user-384729018/episode-5-with-sobia-zaidi )

***Artist:*** Sobia Zaidi | IG: [@sobiazaydi](https://www.instagram.com/sobiazaydi/)
***Bio:*** Sobia Zaidi is a performance artist, playwright and theatre maker. Her practice is concerned with finding and curating the mundane and ordinary as extraordinary. Sobia has always been fascinated by the body both as an object in space and as a subject. The inspiration for her performances comes from the daily life interactions which she re-enacts in the most unexpected sites and contexts. For her the awareness of the body is the beginning of all the politics and its interaction with space is where the performance starts for her. She playfully explores the poetics of anonymity and secrecy in her practice which is why her work is mostly subtle and deliberately unnoticeable. Text is a major part of her practice. She uses text to record the memory of the work and also creates DIY manuals for performances that contain instructions to create performances. She received her Masters in Performance Art and artistic research from Utrecht School of the Arts, Netherlands and is presently the Coordinator of Visual and Performing Arts Program at Forman Christian College, Lahore.

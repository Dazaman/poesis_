### Social Play

Social Play was a two day workshop designed for those interested in movement, theater and art as a form of social change for artists, working professionals and students of any field interested in SEA. The workshop engaged the body in a meditative and creative way while stimulating the mind with issues experienced by participants in Pakistan’s local context.

**Day 1 of ‘Social Play’**
*4th December ‘19*
The workshop was formatted in three stages in the following order: Feeling, Thinking and Conclusion. It consisted of theatre warm ups to shake, loosen and exhaust the participants to create images for Forum Theatre which is a part of the Theatre of the Oppressed.
Mirroring exercises, engaging with sound and meditation, being conscious of our own body language was the first step to induce empathy and anticipation for The Other through guided tasks by the moderators.
Creating images with the body of different roles in society, and themes of conflict was the second.

**Day 2 of ‘Social Play’**
*5th December ‘19*
The second day of the workshop was formatted in three stages in the following order: Thinking, Feeling and Conclusion.
